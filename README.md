# CSCI323-Project-k-shortest-path
# The aim of this project is to use different algorithms to find the K Shortest Path based on 3 datasets included
# The datasets are demo1.txt, demo2.txt and demo3.txt

# Environment Setup:
# This project has 1 dependency which is networkX 3.5
# To install networkX, run in your terminal 'pip install networkX'
# Before we run the programme, please note that for each dataset we will have to run the programme from the beginning again

# Running the programme:
# To run the programme, key into terminal 'python main.py' or if on macOS key in 'python3 main.py'

# FOR DATASET 'demo1.txt':
# The programme will then ask for your input for the datafile, key in 'demo1.txt'
# When prompted for the start node, key in 'A'
# When prompted for goal node, key in 'D'
# When prompted for which algorithm to use, key in '3' this will select the AI recommendation
# When prompted for number of K* / Yen paths, key in '3'
# Allow the programme to run and produce the results
# When prompted on whether you want the AI recommendation or not, key in 'y' 

# FOR DATASET 'demo2.txt':
# Run 'python main.py' or if on macOS key in 'python3 main.py'
# When prompted for the start node, key in 'A'
# When prompted for goal node, key in 'D'
# When prompted for which algorithm to use, key in '3' this will select the AI recommendation
# When prompted for number of K* / Yen paths, key in '3'
# Allow the programme to run and produce the results
# When prompted on whether you want the AI recommendation or not, key in 'y'

# FOR DATASET 'demo3.txt':
# Run 'python main.py' or if on macOS key in 'python3 main.py'
# When prompted for the start node, key in 'r0c0'
# When prompted for goal node, key in 'r29c29'
# When prompted for which algorithm to use, key in '3' this will select the AI recommendation
# When prompted for number of K* / Yen paths, key in '3'
# Allow the programme to run and produce the results
# When prompted on whether you want the AI recommendation or not, key in 'y'
